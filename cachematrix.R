## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## makeCacheMatrix
# The first function, makeCacheMatrix, creates a special "matrix", which is really a 
# list containing a function to:
# 1 set the value of the matrix
# 2 get the value of the matrix
# 3 set the value of the inverse of the matrix using the solve() function
# 4 get the value of the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve #calculates the inverse of the matrix and caches the result
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}

## cacheSolve
# the following function calculates the inverse of the special "vector" created 
# with makeCacheMatrix. However, it first checks to see if the inverse has 
# already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and 
# skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data 
# and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the Solve() function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}


## THE FOLLOWING ARE A LIST OF COMMANDS TO TEST THESE FUNCTIONS

#>setwd("")
#>source("cacheMatrix.R")
#>a <- makeCacheMatrix(matrix(rnorm(25),nrow = 5,ncol = 5))
#>a$get()
#>a$getinverse()
#>cacheSolve(a)
#>a$getinverse()  # this is only to show you that the mean has been stored and does not affect anything
#>cacheSolve(a)
